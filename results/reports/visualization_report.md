## Analysis Summary

The visualization analysis provides comprehensive insights into:

1. **Stress Distribution**: Shows how different load cases affect stress patterns
2. **Displacement Analysis**: Reveals maximum displacements and convergence behavior
3. **Optimization Convergence**: Demonstrates algorithm performance and solution quality
4. **3D Geometry**: Provides spatial understanding of the mount structure

## Recommendations

Based on the visualization analysis:
- Monitor stress concentrations at mounting points
- Verify displacement limits are within acceptable ranges
- Ensure optimization convergence is achieved
- Consider geometry modifications for improved performance

## Usage

1. Open PNG files in any image viewer for static analysis
